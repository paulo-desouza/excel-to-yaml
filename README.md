# excel-to-yaml


I made a form in Excel for collecting data. This program takes the data from the excel sheets, structures them using dictionaries and lists, and outputs it into a YAML file. 

Feel free to use it as an example or template, its a really simple snippet of code, but also really useful. 

Using OpenPyXL for the spreadsheet reading. 

A very good alternative to forms when collecting data, depending on what exactly you need. More versatile, for sure.
